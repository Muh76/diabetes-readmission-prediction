# NEXT STEPS - PHASE 2: MODEL TRAINING

## Immediate Actions Required
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Remove leaky features
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Create feature documentation
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**: Clinical validation of features
4. üöÄ **READY**: Proceed to model training

## Clinical Validation Checklist
- [ ] Review feature documentation with clinical experts
- [ ] Validate feature ranges against medical literature
- [ ] Confirm no temporal leakage in remaining features
- [ ] Approve feature set for production use

## Model Training Preparation
- [ ] Baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- [ ] Advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- [ ] Hyperparameter optimization (Optuna)
- [ ] Model evaluation and selection
- [ ] SHAP/LIME interpretability analysis

## Risk Mitigation
- Monitor model performance closely
- Validate predictions against clinical expectations
- Document any unexpected model behavior
- Plan for model retraining with improved features
