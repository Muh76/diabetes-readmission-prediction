# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway

### 1. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**
- Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Choose your `diabetes-readmission-prediction` repository

### 2. **Automatic Deployment**
Railway will automatically:
- Detect the `railway.json` configuration
- Use the `Dockerfile` for building
- Install dependencies from `requirements-railway.txt`
- Deploy your FastAPI application

### 3. **Environment Variables (Optional)**
Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT`: Railway-assigned port
- `HOST`: 0.0.0.0

### 4. **Deployment Status**
- **Build**: Docker image creation
- **Deploy**: Container deployment
- **Health Check**: Automatic `/health` endpoint verification

## 🎯 **What's Fixed**

✅ **Removed problematic `azure-ml==1.12.0` package**
✅ **Created Railway-optimized requirements**
✅ **Updated Dockerfile for Railway compatibility**
✅ **Added Railway configuration file**
✅ **Fixed port environment variable handling**

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all packages in `requirements-railway.txt` are available
3. Ensure Dockerfile syntax is correct

### Common Issues:
- **Package not found**: Remove problematic packages
- **Port binding**: Railway handles ports automatically
- **Memory limits**: Railway provides adequate resources

- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **API Docs**: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`
- **Prediction**: `https://your-app.railway.app/predict`
