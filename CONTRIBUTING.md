## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow **PEP 8** with some additional guidelines:

```python
# ✅ Good
def predict_readmission_risk(
    patient_data: Dict[str, Any],
    model_version: str = "latest"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Predict 30-day readmission risk for a patient.
    
    Args:
        patient_data: Patient clinical data
        model_version: Model version to use
        
    Returns:
        Prediction results with risk score and confidence
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

# ❌ Bad
def predict(data,ver='latest'):
  # No type hints, poor formatting
  pass
```

### File Organization

```
src/
├── api/           # FastAPI endpoints
├── app/           # Streamlit dashboard
├── data/          # Data processing
├── features/      # Feature engineering
├── models/        # Model training
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Files**: `snake_case.py`
- **Directories**: `snake_case/`

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```python
# tests/test_models.py
import pytest
from src.models.predictor import DiabetesPredictor

class TestDiabetesPredictor:
    def test_prediction_accuracy(self):
        """Test prediction accuracy with known data."""
        predictor = DiabetesPredictor()
        result = predictor.predict(sample_data)
        assert 0 <= result['risk_score'] <= 1
        assert 'confidence' in result

    def test_invalid_input_handling(self):
        """Test handling of invalid input data."""
        predictor = DiabetesPredictor()
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            predictor.predict(invalid_data)
```

### Test Requirements

- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure response times meet requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

```python
def calculate_clinical_risk_score(
    procedures: int,
    diagnoses: int,
    medications: int
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate clinical risk score based on patient complexity.
    
    This function creates a composite risk score that combines
    the number of procedures, diagnoses, and medications to
    assess patient complexity and readmission risk.
    
    Args:
        procedures: Number of procedures performed
        diagnoses: Number of diagnoses recorded
        medications: Number of medications prescribed
        
    Returns:
        Clinical risk score between 0 and 1
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If any input is negative
        
    Example:
        >>> score = calculate_clinical_risk_score(2, 5, 8)
        >>> 0 <= score <= 1
        True
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### API Documentation

All API endpoints should include:
- **Description**: What the endpoint does
- **Parameters**: Input parameters and types
- **Response**: Expected response format
- **Examples**: Request/response examples
- **Error Codes**: Possible error responses

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Credential Management

- **Never commit credentials** to the repository
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Follow least privilege** principle
- **Rotate credentials** regularly

### Code Security

```python
# ✅ Secure - Validate input data
def validate_patient_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Validate patient data before processing."""
    required_fields = ['age', 'gender', 'time_in_hospital']
    return all(field in data for field in required_fields)

# ❌ Insecure - No input validation
def process_patient_data(data):
    # Direct use without validation
    return process_raw_data(data)
```

## 🏥 Healthcare-Specific Guidelines

### Clinical Validation

- **Domain Review**: Have healthcare experts review clinical logic
- **Literature Review**: Base features on published research
- **Clinical Testing**: Validate with real clinical data when possible
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations

### Ethical Considerations

- **Fairness**: Test for bias across demographic groups
- **Transparency**: Provide explanations for predictions
- **Privacy**: Protect patient privacy and data
- **Safety**: Ensure predictions don't harm patients

### Clinical Documentation

```python
def predict_readmission_risk(patient_data):
    """
    Predict 30-day hospital readmission risk.
    
    Clinical Notes:
    - Based on validated clinical risk factors
    - Reviewed by healthcare domain experts
    - Validated against published literature
    - Includes confidence intervals for uncertainty
    
    Clinical Limitations:
    - Not a substitute for clinical judgment
    - Requires clinical validation in practice
    - May not generalize to all patient populations
    """
    pass
```
